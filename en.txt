moth codling moth is a member of the family are major pests to agricultural mainly fruits such as apples and the larvae are not able to feed on they are highly dependent on fruits as a food source and thus have a significant impact on caterpillars bore into fruit and stop it from which leads to premature means of including and have been moth has a widespread being found on six behavior such as diapause and multiple generations per breeding season have allowed this moth to persist even during years of bad climatic the geographic origin of codling moths is there are theories of these moths originating from either or the believe that the codling moths were introduced to the in the is still debate on whether or not these moths have been distributed by the codling moths are spread all over the ranging from and and islands in the and fitness of the codling moths are highly dependent on humidity levels and the optimal conditions for moth growth and survival were and if the temperature is low and high levels of relative humidity and led to hindrance in a temperature below the larvae become completely inactive and turn seemingly researchers observed that if the temperature is returned to optimal the larvae regained normal moths have been located at altitudes as high as the codling moth is or able to utilize a variety of food the availability of specific food resources does not determine their optimal stages of the moth's life from eggs to can be found on host plants which the larvae feed plants include and even apricot moths are not as the full grown adult codling moth has an average length of and wingspan of wings fold into a shape when the moths are are distinguished from other similar moths in the family by the distinctive patterns on their brown spots enclosed in gold rings are called because they resemble small mirrors with a golden slender antennae are mildly curved near the distal dorsal side of the abdomen is smooth and while the ventral side is covered in most of the moths are brown or gray in it has been observed that the maturity of the fruits the larvae feed on can lead to variation in color in the adult codling moth caterpillars bore into a fruit within hours of hatching from their usually traveling between to in search of a they are susceptible to drying or being washed away between the period of hatching and boring into a the caterpillars are prompt in finding a fruit to feed apples are their dominant food they are feeding on a wide variety of fruits from and are unable to survive by feeding on leaves of the fruit was previously believed that the searching behavior of the caterpillar for fruit to feed on or for a pupation site was the caterpillar is exposed and susceptible to drying and even energy depletion during this searching it was hypothesized that the searching behavior uses thigmotactic which means the caterpillars use contact reflex to also use phototaxis to locate fruits to feed are which means they move towards is adaptive because fruits tend to be located at the ends of the branches where there is most by following the larvae are able to move closer to the caterpillar has located a fruit to feed it starts penetrating the epidermis of the the caterpillar makes way into the scraps of the and frass build up near the entrance of the pieces are glued together by silk threads released from the caterpillar to create a cap protects the caterpillar by blocking the takes the caterpillar approximately minutes to bore into the fruit and about minutes to caterpillar bores through the fruit until it reaches the seminal chamber of the the caterpillar bites into the seeds and halts the growth of the fruit ripens prematurely as a doing the caterpillar gains beneficial such as albumin and feeding behavior lasts for to days and the caterpillar feeds on an average of one to two fruits during this attacked by the codling moth caterpillars have developed methods of resisting the of resistance include thickening of the epidermis of the fruit and using stony cells to protect the of the fruit has also been observed to deter codling moth which are present in some have shown to help in resisting codling moth cells are found in the endocarp of fruits such as cherries or endocarp is the innermost layer of a fruit's stone cells are found in groups of cells found in the fruit cells are found to have thick cell reaching up to these cells are composed out of and which are biopolymers that are commonly found in moths feed little if at feeding may prolong life a little abstaining from feeding does not significantly reduce their reproductive ability to copulate and oviposit are and embryonic development in eggs is not affected by lack of feeding behavior of the parent they choose to the moths feed on sweet such as juice from the diluted and diluted are usually two generations of moths in a given flight period generation moths emerge in and are active through laid by the first generation moths are called second eggs hatch and the caterpillar undergoes pupae go into diapause and over the and of the following these second generation pupae eclose and the second generation moths are active during the months of and on the climatic the number of generations varies in a number of generations is higher closer to the equator in the which indicates that warmer climate is optimal for higher number of for only one generation was in four to five generations have been fly upward near the top of the trees to search for females because females tend to stay near trees that they eclosed or is a major sex pheromone secreted by volatiles create a synergistic effect with the which increases the degree of male volatiles include racemic
or optimal ratio at which attraction is maximized is at a ratio of codlemone to synergistic plant kairomone has been found to be a attractant as which is found in ripe pears and is a minor volatile secreted from ripe attracts both mated and virgin males and moths can copulate as early as the day of their as long as the climate is have developed hooks near the end of the which are used to grasp onto the female during these hooks hold onto the female copulation that lasts up to several hours has been occurs within hours of occurs at a location where an optimal climate and humidity for growth is has been shown that humidity is optimal for and females are more likely to oviposit in the presence of fresh or even fecundity depends greatly on the the temperature is too oviposition is the temperature is too the female may become do not travel far to and generally lay eggs near the tree from which they the female lays but this number may can lay as few as ten eggs or as many as over generation eggs are laid on and second generation eggs are generally oviposited on twigs and favor laying eggs at the upper part of the tree near the edges of the where fruits are most commonly eggs are laid along with sticky mass secreted from the which acts as glue to hold the eggs in place and prevent them from being washed away by which are oviposited on either the fruit or twig depending on the are white and shaped like a convex are usually about in the caterpillar develops inside the the egg changes reddish ring forms first and then a red spot which becomes the head of the typically takes about to days for the eggs to but under optimal they can hatch in as soon as the caterpillar first hatches from the it is about long and in body is divided up into twelve and the color is usually pale the caterpillar undergoes development through five instar it grows to become long and more reddish in the time the caterpillars are fully they are light brown in color and have dark brown sex of the moth is determined during the larval karyotype of codling moths has shown a diploid system which means the offspring receives two sets of one from each have a sex chromosome while males have have two brown spots near the end of the dorsal which become the eggs can hatch at night or depending on direct sunlight can dry up the caterpillar and increases the the caterpillar moves into a shade or crawls to the bottom of the leaf if it hatches during the eggs are glued onto the leaf by the sticky substance secreted by the but the caterpillars are small and light enough to be washed away by rain or blown off the tree by because the caterpillars are so small when they first emerge from the they are more susceptible to rainy and data have shown that crops were attacked less by the moths in rainy pupae are long and can be as wide as color changes as time from the brown color of the caterpillar to light pupa's morphology varies with both sex and pupae are generally longer and wider than the male generation caterpillars secrete smoother and more delicate and thus the cocoon is covered with finer generation cocoons are coarser and have shreds of wood is because second generation caterpillars bore out the bark of the tree to create itself a fifth instar caterpillar seeks for a place to spin the cocoon near the its silk the larva lowers down to the ground from the can also crawl down the trunk of the process of searching for an appropriate place to pupate is long and have been spotted in various such as under old dry places in the ditches dug into storehouse with the under and between clods of first generation pupation lasts a shorter period of usually less than ten the second the duration of pupation is longer at around difference in pupation duration between first and second generation pupae is due to temperature change as the season is a relationship between temperature and duration of warmer temperatures have been found to shorten the first generation which emerge in the warmer months of tend to have a shorter pupation second generation caterpillars pupate over winter and in the spring emerge as first generation cocoon provides sufficient protection from rain and other external except mechanical generation adult moths first emerge in the around the end of to beginning of time and emergence are dependent on temperature and other climatic soon as the moths they oviposit first generation and caterpillars that arise from the eggs bore into the it is critical to predict the time of emergence of the moths in the spring to minimize damages to the of the moth abdomen have sharp notches that can make it easier for the moth to emerge from the notches can be used to cut through the exterior cover of the the moths first or emerge as their wings are not spread out they are not capable of flight immediately after takes about ten minutes for the wings to spread average life span of the moth is around to the longest living male observed lived for and the oldest female lived for or a period of suspended occurs in codling moth caterpillars if the climatic conditions or food availability are in diapause do not spin cocoons but rather enter a stage of decreased metabolism and vital the temperature drops below degrees the caterpillar turns lifeless and becomes a blob of caterpillar becomes so soft that if the place where it is poked will remain caved as if it is made out of heated wax or first generation a greater percentage of the caterpillars entered diapause if they did not pupate by the end of
or beginning of generation diapause is generally to pass through the over the winter is caused by a drop in and once the temperature and humidity rise back up to a favorable activity is explains how codling moths are able to survive even if a sterile apple year the larvae enter diapause and emerge after the bad year has possibility of a diapause has been debated in the literature for several the possibility of diapause is slim because none of the caterpillars out of cocoons observed emerged after a diapause that lasted two of the adult codling moths starts near the beginning of with the eclosion of second generation moths and stops around the end of as the first generation moths reach senescence every first and second generation flight period overlap anywhere from to of second and first generation moth flight period means there will be continuous damage done by the codling moth during the summer moths are generally sedentary and tend to spend the day resting on leaves or limited mobility is not because they are incapable of they have the capacity to travel up to several the majority of the moths travel between and about of the population are wide range of flight behavior is an adaptive their habitat is usually determined by the availability of the so there is normally no need to travel but if the fruits are spread out in a patchy the moths are capable of traveling longer distances to find food and females and males have been shown to be more likely to fly longer with both sexes being able to travel about the same and mated males and virgin females were able to fly the longest during the first third of while mated females reached their maximum potential of flight within days after genetic correlation to was found between total distance traveled and flight such as flight duration and characteristics are shown to be heritable for both for and against genes that increase flight traits showed rapid changes in flight traits in both a between mobility and has shown that sedentary females have higher or the ability to produce than mobile females are larger in lay more and live longer than mobile there is higher reproductive rate in sedentary explains why females do not travel far from the fruit tree from which they emerged to of the codling moth are mostly accounting for nearly of caterpillar are especially significant predators because they find caterpillars from hidden crevices beneath the bark and branches of host are also highly preyed upon by arthropods from the following taxonomic groups beetle which is a kind of ground and are among the most significant of the insect predators because they are numerous and are active in attack all the stages of the codling moth life including the and eclosing of the commonly known ant predators include pallidefulva schauffussi fulva and can kill of caterpillars they which are usually those moving between fruits or fifth instar caterpillars looking for a pupation are also predators of various life stages of the codling feeds on eggs from all while feeds on second generation egg stage is the most vulnerable period for parasitism because it is when the moth is exposed the are protected by the fruit and the pupae are protected by the parasitoids are listed with the parasitized life stage of the codling moth indicated in is a parasite to the caterpillar and pupae of the codling spores of this snowy white fungus are dispersed in locations where the caterpillars pass by or where they mycelium of grows radially out from the body of the turning the caterpillar soft and has a killing rate of in grows favorably in humid and warm is another or fungal parasite to the codling moth this fungus type can grow even if the humidity is bacteria that parasitize the codling moth are and parasitizes the larvae of the codling is a virus common among lepidopteran are two genera in the and a granulovirus species specific to codling moths has been identified and form small granules that each carry one can be divided into two the 'slow' and 'fast' which refers to the rate at which the virus kills the granuloviruses usually kill the host during the same instar in which it was pomonella granulovirus is a species of fast granulovirus that is fatally pathogenic to codling pomonella granulovirus is a fast the codling moth larvae dies within the same instar as when complete genome of pomonella granulovirus has been sequenced and was found to have main pomonella granulovirus isolates have been pomonella can be categorized into four genome genomes and is believed that genome is ancestral to the other is also less pathogenic to codling moth neonates compared to other genome from have also been identified and were found to have same genome types as the other pomonella which is a isolate strain of pomonella has been used as a moth larvae can be infected with pomonella granulovirus just by crawling or browsing on infected leaves and linear log relationship has been which indicates that the longer the larva remains in contact with the bioinsecticide sprayed the higher the degree of suspension of the granules are sprayed on leaves and which are then taken up by the pomonella granulovirus works most effectively when taken up by neonate so the bioinsecticide should be applied in concordance to the hatching time schedule of the the granules reach the which is basic the granules are dissolved and invade the tracheal fat and other tissue the later stages of the virus form which causes or programmed of host cells and eventually host of the host occurs within colonies of codling moths have developed resistance against the commonly used pomonella some pomonella isolates have overcome that host such as and have shown increased pathogenicity against which are pomonella granulovirus resistant colonies of codling moths used in antennae of the moths are used to detect volatiles released by fruits
like apples and and females display similar antennal responses to most except to responded more strongly to codlemone than apple volatiles include and volatiles include pear ester ethyl is a corresponding aldehyde for and is released as a defense mechanism by the fifth instar larvae of the apple sawfly infested with apple sawflies are unsuitable for codling moth larvae because apple sawflies secrete as part of their defense also causes a decrease in codling moth male so female codling moths are deterred by this is a major volatile released by ripe apples that attracts codling dimorphism in olfaction has been discovered with regards to this mated and virgin females were attracted to at a low dosage but repelled by it at a high degree of response was stronger for mated to mated males were attracted to a higher dosage of while mid to low dosage elicited neutral threshold for mated male attraction was which means the males are not as sensitive to the volatile as the females hexanoate is another volatile released by ripe females were attracted by this volatile while males were not the caterpillar of the codling moth bore into fruits and stop their codling moths are major agricultural are widespread and attack a wide range of order to control these insecticide has been used study done in in the late and early showed that damage from codling moths ranged from to of crops being case study at project sites in and showed that the number of hectares of farms treated with mating disruption insecticides to control codling moths has grown exponentially from to pruning the branches of the fruit trees will allow insecticide to reach the insides of the crown crown of a tree is the and fruits of the tree that stems from the tree more sunlight can reach the branches after and sunlight is deadly to the eggs and bark from the tree trunk can decrease the number of sites available for fruits should be gathered and disposed of bore into the fruit and cause premature ripening of the fruit and causing the fruit to fall off of the rid of fallen fruits can eliminate caterpillars that are still inside the fruits that have banding consists of wrapping a corrugated cardboard strip around the tree making their way down the tree to pupate after exiting the infested fruits will use bands as pupation may then be removed and consists of placing kairomonal lures on a high density of sticky traps in male and female moths are attracted to the lure and become stuck in the experiment conducted over years showed a significant decrease in the number of apples damaged by codling films are hydrophobic solutions used to spray crops and plants to prevent damage from pathogens and arthropod common type of particle film is composed primarily of kaolin clay and is a white material that is found commonly in and is an aluminosilicate which means it is composed of and clay particle films are used to slow down the activity of larvae and trees coated with particle the larvae displayed decreased walking fruit scavenging and penetration hatching rate of the eggs did not differ between treated and untreated female moths oviposited less on development of synthetic fruit volatiles has led to increased control of codling moths can be managed and controlled with the use of synthetic apple such as and and other synthetic such as pear ester ethyl and its corresponding are used as lures in codling moth and are widely used in codling moth management programs in growth inhibitors and insect growth regulators are used in especially to prevent the synthesis of chitin during is one of the major component which constitutes the exoskeleton of arthropods and cell walls of insects cannot develop such as hexaflumuron and have been shown to be effective against egg is an ovicidal while is a larvicidal and are an and respectively and are equally effective in preventing growth in eggs as in addition to pesticides are also used to control codling moth population in apple recent codling moths with strains have become resistant to macrocyclic is believed that this resistance is due to increase in enzymatic activity of the genetic structuration and high rate of gene flow have led to a rapid spread of resistance in there is a fitness cost associated with increased insecticide codling moths are less less slower in lighter in and have a shorter life span compared to is believed to be caused by increase in the metabolically costly activities of oxidase and is an enzyme that catalyzes is an enzyme that catalyzes a detoxification process involving a conjugation of gluthione into xenobiotic codling moth is not a great candidate for biological pest as the larvae are well protected within the fruit for the majority of their eggs are susceptible to biological control by wasps deposit their eggs into codling moth and the developing wasp larvae consume the moth embryo candidate for a biological control agent is the wasp also known as the wasp has exhibited a positive response to higher densities of codling moth a short generation time compared to other parasites of the codling and a high number of female offspring per host characteristics improve ability to control codling moth of overwintering codling moth cocoons has reached up to but most field tests have not demonstrated a dramatic as a biological control is

other which he would film's budget was was first film for followed by a month provided the voice of the directed some underwater sequences also appeared in a small had just read by and found it to be new and when that picture came wrote all the underwater stuff and went to and told him direct all the underwater parts for said had just he would have said had to put it in a way that he would jump directed all that stuff and it was rather be down at the bottom of the tank at trying to get actors to do something while of was hammering at the glass window trying to get them to do something was all pretty film was distributed as the main feature on a double bill with of an estimated of the was most profitable production up to that which he attributed to the of the the construction of the the structuring of every scene for horror and and editing for was the most successful of all the early low budget horror think its success had something to do with the wildness of the title even is pretty do think a lot of its popularity had to do with the construction of the always believed in horror and science fiction too much time is usually spent explaining the characters in depth and developing various audiences really come to these movies for their science fiction elements or their shock course they want to understand the characters and want to empathize with them all in order to share the emotions they don't wish to do that at the expense of the other aspects of the talked to about and worked out a general storyline before he went to work on the told don't want any scene in this picture that doesn't either end with a shock or the suspicion that a shocking event is about to take that's how the finished script always had the feeling when watching the movie that anything was about to think this plus the fact that the creature was big and won has stated that the success of the film convinced him that horror and humor was an effective to the film was one of a wave of teen

practical and commercially successful analog recording video tape was developed and released for the broadcast television industry in by an company based in first videotape recorder using this format was built in the same format revolutionized broadcast television operations and television since the only recording medium available to the industry before then was film used for which was much more costly to utilize and took time to develop at a film kinescope images were usually of obviously inferior quality to the live television broadcast images they whereas quadruplex videotape preserved almost all the image detail of a live most network broadcast delays done by the television networks at the time were done with film kinescopes that needed time for the networks wanted a more and quicker way to television programming for later airing on the than the expense and time consumption of the processing and editing of film with these broadcasters sought to adapt magnetic tape recording technology in use for recording for use with television as term refers to the use of four magnetic heads mounted on a headwheel spinning transversely across the tape at a rate of recorded stripes per for quad and at stripes per for those using the video method is called quadrature as opposed to the helical scan transport used by later videotape tape ran at a speed of either per second for video or per second for the and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion near the edges of the cue track was used either as a second audio or for recording cue tones or time code for linear video typical reel of quad tape holds approximately one hour of recorded material at per quadruplex format employs segmented each transversely recorded video track on a quad videotape holds or

reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape was playing at normal it was capable of producing extremely images containing about lines of video and remained the industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in to the when and videotape formats superseded were three different variations of quad machines made later in the and by can play back both low and quad of television programming for the of the by the networks in the order to broadcast their programming at the same local time on the and using kinescope films was quite a rushed and perilous was because there were only three hours for the branches of the networks to receive video for the programming from the via leased microwave relay or coaxial cable circuits provided by the phone company at the and then to record such to kinescope and finally to develop the film to be aired three hours later on the usually meant the kinescope was aired almost immediately after it came straight out of the developing still warm from the film were referred to by the networks as the networks used more raw film stock for kinescopes than all of the film studios spending up to per half were desperate to obtain a less and more practical the early and several other companies such as and were competing to release a videotape and did release working prototypes of their but their downfall was that they all used a longitudinal method of much like audio tape meant that the tape had to be recorded at an extremely high speed in order to accommodate sufficient bandwidth to reproduce an adequate video image least for a watchable in turn requiring large amounts of tape on large the same the developed a similar video tape recorder system that saw some called seeing the impracticality of the prototype and started to develop a more practical videotape format with tape economy in as well as providing
a solution to the networks' delay in built the prototype using decided that instead of having the tape move at high speed past a stationary head to record enough bandwidth for the head would be made to move rapidly across the relatively slow moving resulted in the using arcuate which consisted of a spinning disk with a face the heads were which contacted the tape opposed to the edge of the headwheel with transverse quadrature resulted in an track being recorded across the width of the scanning resulted in a speed of about but problems with timebase stability of the reproduced video signal from the tape led to abandon arcuate scanning in favor of the more reliable transverse scanning continued through the with the and prototype which now used transverse used frequency modulation

danceable and love big fat beats and really dig rock 'n' says jazz is my it's my and never left jazz in mind or returned to touring with in support of his tenth studio made her first recording with a working group and called the album because of the tight communication in the wanted to do a quartet record because of the amount of space you get with fewer she said in liner but more dimensional than a piano really into this and it was nice to play with a group that was a can't help but have a better feel when the musicians know each are headed in the same and have the same can make most everything get chances to play a lot of and really stretch your released for the on her rooted in but it's not traditional very very and we really try to expand any ideas we have that everything is played over the but we like to stretch and really see the colors and make the music grow and says experiment but it's never is written have charts for all the expand on what's and stretch harmonics and note continues to make her home in in always such an amazing with every level of musical you can see complete beginners and you can see why live in only is it but all the greatest people have come through says prefers to play jazz in intimate an acoustic are and you are creating one hundred percent of the time so to me it just doesn't really get any better also travels extensively conducting

play an and it's a proposed to on stage during a concert at is touring he proposed immediately after her drum were married on on attended a church during her teenage but became a follower of the at the age of she also started studying in the cultivates spirituality in her believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of whether you're conscious of it or because you have a focused says because you're crossing barriers that a lot of people and even us as musicians don't normally venture because we don't think about you can learn to move those even if they're into something that is of like focusing on bringing light to people who are or just to the universe in then you can do something good with don't keep that in mind per cent of the time human but try is a rarity as a female jazz the there were a lot of stigmas attached to women playing certain think a lot of women stick to particular like that are so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out let's face boys' clubs still care nothing about that at going to do what going to do musically draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a classical pianist and does not let stereotypes deter forbid should be limited to only play my drums in my but if that's all that's what would says or anyone facing race weight hair prejudice if you let somebody stop you because of their then the only thing you're doing is hurting don't want to give somebody that power over is adamant that musicality has nothing to do with gender question is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with there because love to play in support of anyone who wants to play the wouldn't care if was pink with polka dots and wearing a wouldn't care if was are people who have opinions about whatever and in terms of in terms of race and says to your personality influences what you play and what you but

a have some conscious control of their emotional they need not have conscious awareness of their emotional or affective state in order to express in psychology have proposed many different and often competing theoretical models to explain emotions and emotional going as far back as discussion of emotion as an evolved there is no universally accepted theory of theorists in emotion agree that healthy humans experience emotions and express them in a variety of such as with their and cultural norms and beliefs of a society also affect and shape the emotional expressions of its and expressions appropriate and important in one culture may be taboo in shows that gay partners have higher levels of expressiveness than expressiveness could be useful in constructively resolving relationship related are many different theories about
the nature of emotion and the way that it is represented in the brain and the elements that distinguish between the theories of perhaps the most salient is differing perspectives on emotional theories about emotion consider emotions to be biologically basic and stable across people and are often called perspectives because they view emotion as biologically this an individual's emotional expressions are sufficient to determine a person's emotional a person is they are a person is they are emotion has a consistent and specific pattern of and that pattern of responses is only expressed during that emotion and not during other emotional expressions are particularly salient stimuli for transferring important nonverbal signals to that emotional expressions are the best direct indicators of affective attitudes and is growing evidence that brain regions generally engaged in the processing of emotional information are also activated during the processing of facial theories of emotion take the stance that emotional expression is more and that there is a cognitive component to theories account for the malleability in emotion by proposing that humans appraise situations depending on the result of their different emotions and the corresponding expressions of emotion are tendency to appraise certain situations as one emotion or another can vary by person and appraisal models still maintain that there are basic responses that are specific and consistent to each emotion that humans theories of emotion propose that emotions are constructed based upon the and past and that there are no preset emotional responses that are consistent and specific to one emotion or basic model of emotions finds its roots in of in and claimed that the expression of emotions involves many facial behavioral and physical which include and vocal claimed that emotional expression was consistent with his theories on evolution and the expression of emotion is universal and should therefore be expressed similarly across race or is known as the universality primates and animals exhibit precursors of muscle actions of the facial expressions of researchers have expanded on original theories on emotional and colleagues were the first to test through empirical tests found that there were a number of basic emotions that were universally studies suggested that facial expressions are unique to each emotion and are signals that convey information of one's internal and this information is used to coordinate social the basic emotion perspective assumes that emotions are unique events that occur as a result of special and each emotion has its own respective specific brain the expression of each emotion has its own respective manifestation in and basic emotion view to create the and is a database of compiled facial wherein each facial movement is termed an action unit explains how to become keen at observing emotion in the faces of consists of the which trains individuals to disambiguate between emotional expressions through recognizing distinct facial expressions that are unique to each second part of this training program trains individuals to read a face elicits an emotion very quickly and the individual is prompted to report which emotion was trains individuals to be able to recognize the subtle changes in a person's facial expression due to slight changes in emotional subtle expressions can occur at the onset of or when an individual is actively suppressing the models of emotion state that emotions are triggered by mental states that are truly unique in both form and models are similar to the basic model of emotion in that both views consider once an emotion is emotional expressions are biologically predetermined and are displayed only in one emotion and every time that emotion is main difference between basic emotion models and appraisal models is that appraisal models assume that there is a cognitive antecedent that determines which emotion is appraisal theories consider appraisals to be universal and like a set of switches that can be turned on by biological and environmental a person makes an an individual will react with an emotional response that can include an emotional recent appraisal models account for variation in emotional expression by suggesting that cognitive appraisals are more like themes that can be triggered by a number of different actions and expressions arise from these which essentially describe the context of the appraisal model has developed the law of situational which states that emotions tend to be evoked by certain kinds of grief is elicited by personal this personal loss would be the appraisal and one can express grief through emotional model of called psychological describes emotion as a construction that results from more basic psychological a psychological construction basic psychological processes like affect or negative feeling combined with some degree of physiological previous and executive functioning combine to form a discrete emotion some discrete emotions tend to have typical responses crying when laughing when a psychological construction model can account for the wide variability in emotional expression crying when extremely laughing when construction models call into question the assumption that there are discrete emotion expressions that are universally basic emotion studies use highly stereotypical facial expressions as emotional signals such as a which would indicate one is feeling facial expressions can be better understood as symbols of emotion rather than these symbols have undeniable emotional meaning and are consistently observed during emotional behavior they do not have a relationship a person's internal mental or emotional not everyone furrows their brow when they are feeling these emotional symbols are not universal due to cultural when individuals are asked to identify an emotional expression on a specific in an experimental they focus on the target's facial individuals use the information of the surrounding faces to determine the emotional state of the target challenges experiments that solely use a presentation of an isolated emotional expression in experiments because it is reflecting just a notion of construction models generally say that there is no biological circuitry for emotions since emotions are solely based on experience and even suggest that certain emotions can only exist in the reciprocal exchanges of a social there

the case of expression can help people take control of their emotions and facilitate to help them reappraise their emotional expression through writing can help people better understand their and subsequently regulate their emotions or adjust their research by people who observed a traumatic death showed more improvements in physical health and subjective after writing about their emotions over several research also shows that these benefits only appear when individuals undergo a cognitive such as in gaining insight about their expression has social implications as emotions are related

cover versions of and with some original compositions also lead singer changed their set to entirely original removed all of the early band members and officially named the band derived from a local anecdotal description that the original members were bunch of and the band underwent a number of incarnation of consisted of on lead on lead on bass and on was replaced by shortly also left and joined on joined as rhythm guitarist in and in late replaced of the band's consists of and the band released its debut consisted of four and of the album did not receive a significant amount of with many stores and archives listing their second released in as their first consists of four new tracks and a of the song of the from the first releasing the band won the of the and competed in the held in the band were chosen to support the due to the and his band were forced to cancel their the end of the band played a support set for wrote the
tracks for first album and he stated that they played songs from together as a band only after it was by not only wrote all of the album's songs and played but also played drums on every track except as had not yet joined the was released independently on and was distributed via signed a licensing deal with a indie album was issued in the on and in the on band also the on following the success of completed the shortly after the release of late they played with the in this time also contributed a cover of song to the album which contains covers and remixes of songs from and does not feature on any and also played guitar and bass respectively on the title track of the album by group touring in the returned to in and subsequently entered the studio to write their to stated that the new album would be a huge progression from while stated that the writing process of the new record was a collaborative effort by the in contrast to their previous disclosed their new recording strategy for the second try to focus less on minute details and record a more album was again produced and mixed by band continued to tour including the and their live performances for the they played some of the new songs from the such as and in they debuted a fifth new song entitled to the which was confirmed as the first single from the new songs were considered more while still bearing resemblance to the band's previous the video for to the was released and on peaked at on the singles album was released on and debuted at on the and on the the album received certification for sales in band toured in support of followed by shows in and then the to headline in band then toured the in and published a music video on for their second single was released by in the and on followed the release with a tour with to a successful tour of and the returned to and announced the national shows and a show quickly sold unprecedented in and further shows in and were consequently band then temporarily ceased touring so that could tour with his other band of touring resumed by the back of the band played its first ever show in in performance in attracted people as of is the band's biggest with and confetti cannons going and big movie screens on either side of the stage in this big amphitheatre and people singing explained the a result of file sharing and in a was played a lot of countries but to go to a place like you all we thought we had in common was cricket but was very was our first show didn't even have a release or didn't even realise we had a following then we announced the show and all these messages started coming back through social media a beer in the hotel room we were like the that actually after returning to in the band is planning on starting to write material for a third reiterated stating the band plans on demoing songs for the third album at this and described the material departure from whilst still holding all the principles that make for a announced three shows in their native shows will be the last of the as well as a possible pointer of things to these shows they debuted a new song and stated that the band was working in the studio on their third tour continued throughout the rest of and later in the year the band toured for the cultural festival in the tour was announced and the band confirmed that new material would be played during the band played theatre shows around with support from and instrumental group band returned to in for some additional shows during the same announced that they were recording their third album at studios in band toured again in performing shows in and before the for the band announced that they had entered the mixing phase of the third album with producer while on the band's management the night watching the new doco and listening to the new the studio version of was premiered on radio station song became available as a free download on the radio station's website the following day and members of the band's mailing list received the download later in the band's first show for the year was at of the festival on at the and the festival's promotional material stated that a of the band's new single would occur at the music video directed by was filmed in but the name of the song was not disclosed at the time that the production information was made the music video was released and the song is called band also revealed the track list and cover art for their third entitled aired the radio debut of the on the programme and explained to one of the station's really harks to what we try to do musically as a and we go too far and we get so we backtrack a bit and find exactly what we're looking with of explained that the recording process is difficult for the band and despite efforts to try and shorten the duration between the band has managed to release three albums in fifteen something we grapple with all the try to speed it up and make the frequency of album releases a lot completely mystified by the songwriting and that's the bottom line for us we don't know what we're feels like it's out of our control a lot of the was released on and a deal was secured with for the album debuted in the number position of the the receipt of an award for first time the band has won an stated in a interview that just one of those things where it’s almost like it validates us in other people’s
further explained that the album was created as a reaction to his perception of a current musical whereby heavy progressive music to me is losing a lot of the human gridlocking everything and cutting out all the air between the the and all announced that the band would undertake a national tour with and sleepmakeswaves during and appear in the documentary film played three festivals in the band

was announced in and released on technical target for was to use and improve the dominance game strategic dominance called simply occurs when one strategy is better than another strategy for one no matter how that player's opponents may simple games can be solved using occurs in games where one strategy may be better or worse than another strategy for one depending on how the player's opponents may a player tries to choose the strategy among a multitude of that player may compare two strategies and to see which one is result of the comparison is one notion can be generalized beyond the comparison of two complete contingent plan for a player in the complete contingent plan is a full specification of a player's describing each action a player would take at every possible decision information sets represent points in a game where a player must make a a player's strategy describes what that player will do at each information assumption that each player acts to in a way that is designed to bring about what he or she most prefers given probabilities of various von and showed that if these preferences satisfy certain this is mathematically equivalent to maximizing a straightforward example of maximizing payoff is that of monetary but for the purpose of a game theory this payoff can take any it a cash minimization of exertion or promoting spread of ones or amassing overall “utility” the assumption of rationality states that players will always act in the way that best satisfies their ordering from best to worst of various possible assumption that each player has knowledge of the knows the rules and payoffs associated with each course of and realizes that every other player has this same level of is the premise that allows a player to make a value judgment on the actions of another backed by the assumption of into consideration when selecting an a strictly dominant strategy exists for one player in a that player will play that strategy in each of the game's both players have a strictly dominant the game has only one unique that equilibrium is not necessarily meaning that there may be outcomes of the game that would be better for both classic game used to illustrate this is the dominated strategies cannot be a part of a and as it is irrational for any player to play the other weakly dominated
strategies may be part of consider the payoff matrix pictured at the weakly dominates strategy playing one's opponent plays one gets if one's opponent plays one gets this to where one gets in one one does better by playing instead of and never does weakly dominates is a both players choose player will do any better by unilaterally deviating—if a player switches to playing they will still get satisfies the requirements of a both players choose player will do better by unilaterally deviating—if a player switches to playing they will get also satisfies the requirements of a iterated elimination of dominated strategies denominated as or is one common technique for solving games that involves iteratively removing dominated the first at most one dominated strategy is removed from the strategy space of each of the players since no rational player would ever play these results in a smaller strategies—that were not dominated before—may be dominated in the smaller first step is creating a new even smaller and so process stops when no dominated strategy is found for any process is valid since it is assumed that rationality among players is common that each player knows that the rest of the players are and each player knows that the rest of the players know that he knows that the rest of the players are and so on ad infinitum are two versions of this version involves only eliminating strictly dominated after completing this there is only one strategy for each player that strategy set is the unique version involves eliminating both strictly and weakly dominated at the end of the there is a single strategy for each this strategy set is also a unlike the first elimination of weakly dominated strategies may eliminate some a the equilibrium found by eliminating weakly dominated strategies may not be the some if we remove weakly dominated strategies in a different we may end up with a different any if by iterated elimination of dominated strategies there is only one strategy left for each the game is called a with with with is the fourth album by alternative band released in album was highly being the first album released on a major label since their debut with a

indie while other critics felt the record was too cold and that could only be enjoyed at a the lukewarm many of the band's fans now consider with to be citing its quirky songwriting and diversity as contains a wide variety of styles ranging from and to and orchestral album also contains a few slightly more conventional addition to the album was also released on with bonus and as a limited edition

pottery finds suggests that its origins are significantly older and may date to the late or around the seventh century appears to have been abandoned some time around the century but was possibly in

also known by the name as part of celebrations for its a series of roads were deemed to be part of that commemorated various paths taken during military was a part of the path called of the which included the connection between and route commemorated a military campaign led by innovative main concept of this featuring four adjacent main spans sustained by three consecutive harps of stays three tall towers and with the central tower being the central main pylon of in was designed by engineer head of the company for the account of the federal de y of and detailed design was also achieved by and from did the structural engineering the engineering designs were checked by and the cables were supplied by calculation of the static and dynamic effects of turbulent wind on the when in service and under was carried out using the computer taking into account the aerodynamic measurements made at the on a model of the bridge with the help of studies of the behavior of this bridge under seismic conditions were also carried out using the same computer valley over which the bridge passes is approximately bridge consists of six with lengths of the spans in the following and for a total length of bridge is categorized as a and has supports with piers of the bridge were constructed with reinforced cement the superstructure and the cable are made of supported concrete pylon was adopted due to high seismic conditions of the multispan stayed or cable bridge suffered damages to one of the stay cables with a minor damage to an adjoining cable during a fire that was created due to an accident

restored when the cable replacement of the cause of the fire by the of and the and indicated that the polyethylene which has hydrocarbon was not ideally fire resistant as it caught fire and created the additional fire load which resulted in snapping of one cable moot question that was posed in the analysis was this bridge have survived the loss of two or three adjacent also showed that multiple cables could be included in a fire caused by a lightning designers have examined the lacunae in design of major long span bridges of various types in the keeping in view the failures that have occurred in many bridges including the limited failure of the cable of the due to a single point loading event that occurred due to a study was done with the objective enhance the reliability and safety of these major structures in the built approach now under consideration for cable stayed bridge is more rational approach from assigning factors of safety to key elements such as suspenders and

sponsor the the contracts were signed between the two meaning that the new name would be with the renaming taking effect from the team was unveiled in as showing their new black and yellow team had previously been confirmed as the teams title supermarket was presented as the second sponsor of the the team confirmed they would continue to ride on bikes for the and the first rest day of the de the

which the team defended to the end of the earning and their third team has dominated the sport in the past with and winning the competitions such as the the and the van trophy over the last eight dominated the championships for many left the team after the was at that time one of the few remaining riders from the joined the team in as a junior rider and has already achieved success in the championships as well as showing promise riding in the with the announced in that it would end its sponsorship of professional cycling at the end of the with the team announcing its intention to

small pasture with a which colt was gelded as a although he managed to cover four mares before that young horse was slowly broken and later bought by in competed him in show jumping and trained him up to intermediate level in the pair was for the decided to sell the bought him and later lent him to brought him to level in dressage for was offered to ride by as his experienced horse was he tried the gelding and brought him back to his place to get the horse was a bit fat at that and had to be bedded on newspaper as he would try to eat other the weight off the horse was always quite a won his first two events with and then won the and at of which he led after dressage and finished on his dressage pair was then selected for the was moved to in the trip he became and the illness never really left him for the rest of his gelding was taken to the later that where he finished in place on his dressage satisfying finish came a few months at the and finished well after and then put in a clear and stadium rail down by who was leading by a few allowed the pair to cinch the individual the decided to sell her for some reason she did not seem to want to continue with as a she offered to the rider that wanted the horse managed a deal with him to buy behind transferred pounds to to which she paid and now was the official rider of under to was not continued to compete in where he placed second at the and won every event of the season in which they except after a fall on the pair went to the in they had a fall at the and two rails down in and they finished in redeemed themselves a few weeks later in where they won both individually and as part of a composite never got his chance to win as it was cancelled in won the in and the pair almost won that but two rails down in show jumping dropped them to later won the before shipping to the put in a stellar dressage and jumped clear rounds in both the and won the individual gold yet

several types of adjacency queries about neighboring vertices and in constant kind of adjacency information is useful for algorithms such as  winged edge data structure explicitly describes the geometry and topology of and vertices when three or more surfaces come together and meet at a common ordering is such that the surfaces are ordered with respect to the innate orientation of the intersection the representation allows numerically unstable situations like that depicted  winged edge data structure allows for quick traversal between and vertices due to the explicitly linked structure of the serves adjacency queries in constant time with little storage rich form of specifying an unstructured grid is in contrast to simpler specifications of polygon meshes such as a node and element or the implied connectivity of a regular alternative to the winged edge data structure is the data face and vertex records are relatively while the edge record is more each its record stores only the vertex' position and a reference to one incident edge other edges can be found by following further references in the each face record only stores a reference to one of the edges surrounding the the structure of the edge record is as edge is assumed to be edge record contains two references to the vertices that make up the endpoints of the two references to the faces on either

thin or plastic attached to a lightweight wire or plastic handle or wood or metal handle about venting or perforations minimize the disruption of air which can be detected by the fly and allow it to and also reduce air making it easier to hit a target such as a flyswatter is ideally lightweight and allowing quick acceleration to overcome the fast reaction time of the while also minimizing damage caused by hitting other flyswatter usually works by mechanically crushing the fly against a hard after the user has waited for the fly to land some skilled users can injure or stun an airborne insect in by whipping the swatter through the air at an extreme abeyance of insects by use of short horsetail staffs and fans is earliest flyswatters were in fact nothing more than some sort of striking

derivative of the uses a plastic projectile to mechanically on the projectile is a perforated circular disk according to advertising splat the similar products are mostly as toys or novelty although their supporters maintain that they work as well as traditional fly design has a pair of mesh sheets spring loaded to 'clap' together when a trigger is squashing the fly between contrast to the traditional such a design can only be used on an insect in projectile fly killer is the a miniaturized shotgun which shoots a spray of dry table salt using a air blast similar to a has an accurate

whole for easy pneumatic approach is claimed to be effective because the high salt grains are apparently undetected by the targeted fly until it is too late to dodge fly bottle or glass flytrap is a passive trap for flying the it is a large bottle of clear glass with a black metal top in which there is a odorous bait is placed in the bottom of the bottle in the form of pieces of enter the bottle in search of food and are then unable to escape because their phototaxis behavior leads them anywhere in the bottle except to the darker top where the entry hole fly bottle is more with small feet that raise it with a trough about an wide and deep that runs inside the bottle all around the central opening at the bottom of the the bottle is stood on a plate and some sugar is sprinkled on the plate to attract the which eventually fly up into the whose trough is filled with beer or into which the flies fall and the the trough was also sometimes filled with a dangerous mixture of and arsenic or mercury of these bottles are the agricultural fly traps used to fight the fruit fly and the olive which have been in use since the are without and the glass is thicker for rough outdoor often involving suspension in a tree or versions of this device are often made of and can be purchased in some hardware can also be improvised from disposable plastic drink fly traps are small “use and

trap and drown in the water glue board is a capture device with a strong small card covered in sticky adhesive is situated in an enclosure so that when the flies come into contact with they remain stuck and die reusable glue board may be renewed through the use of vegetable and then removing the oil with dishwashing detergent and a water the card is disposed of and completely replaced known as fly fly fly fly or fly attracts flies to adhesive so that they can be exposed adhesive strip makes it more than an enclosed glue avoid accidental entanglement with the strips are often hung in

pin to attach it to a with the tube dangling below as a small is not but is replaced when it loses is often impregnated with a slightly odorous chemical to attract more attractiveness of flypaper to other insects as mosquitos and biting is sometimes enhanced by shining a small portable electric light on the sticky bug vacuum vac or is a type of small but powerful portable vacuum usually with internal motor starts quickly and generates strong trapping the flying insect inside the insect may be captured on an adhesive internal or simply held inside the device until it dehydrates and bug vacuums feature designs which keep trapped insects but do not otherwise harm allowing their later devices are popular with amateur and professional and with persons who wish to avoid the killing of design uses a electric fan to suck in flying insects mosquitos and which are weak which are then trapped by a fine mesh grid or to escape the constant the insects quickly dehydrate and variant designs use carbon ultraviolet or chemical scent to attract insects to the designs rely on the natural carbon dioxide or scents emitted by or livestock to attract and simply collect flying insects as they wander close enough to be sucked the continuous breeze produced by a common electric fan has been found to discourage mosquitos from landing and even without trapping or killing the bug zapper electric grid kills insects by electrocution from high voltage on adjacent metallic zappers are generally small appliances intended for use in a fixed as distinguished from hand held electric flyswatters called mosquito racket or zap are devices that resemble badminton rackets or tennis which became popular worldwide in the late was awarded to inventor in for such a handle contains a circuit is composed of an electronic a transformer and a voltage similar to the circuit in an electroshock weapon or stun but with much lower grid of the flyswatter is electrically charged to a voltage of between and volts activated by pressing and holding a the electrically conductive body of a fly nearly bridges the gap between a spark jumps through the capacitor attached to the electrodes discharges during the and this initial discharge usually stuns or kills the the button is still the continuous current will roast and kill the flyswatters have a grid to prevent people from touching both outermost grids or rods are at the same electrical and are open enough to allow an insect to contact the inner charged electric flyswatters conform to electrical safety standards for advantage over conventional flyswatters is that the electrical models do not have to mechanically crush the fly against a hard surface to kill avoiding the smeared mess this can the electrical grid can be relatively reducing air resistance and a rush of air that often deflects smaller insects around conventional of electric swatters can also be very effective in killing airborne mosquitos and is a

that there was a correlation with the content and the nuclear volume while and van’t and before him postulated that even cell size and length were controlled by the amount of recent theories have brought us to discuss about the possibility of the presence of a mechanism that constrains physically the development of the genome to an optimal explanations have been disputed by article  where the author pointed that the way to understand the relation between genome size and cell volume was related to the skeletal nucleus of this theory is related to the cell determined by an adaptation balance between advantages and disadvantages of bigger cell the optimization of the ratio and the concept that larger genomes provides are more prone to the accumulation of duplicative transposons as consequences of higher content of skeletal also proposed as consequent reaction of a cell the nucleus will be more prone to a selection in favor for the deletion compared to the the economic way of since phosphorus and energy are a reduction in the should be always the focus of the unless a benefit is random deletion will be then mainly deleterious and not selected due to the reduction of the gained fitness but occasionally the elimination will be advantageous as between economy and accumulation of is the key to the maintenance of the karyoplasmatic base question behind the process of genome miniaturization is whether is occur trough large steps or due to a constant erosion of the gene order to assess the evolution of this process is necessary to compare an ancestral genome with the one where the shrinkage is supposed to be to the similarity among the gene content of and the enteric bacteria identity for the and for orthologous genes was possible to shed light on the mechanism of genome genome of the endosymbiont is characterized by a genome size that is seven times smaller than kb compared to and can be view as a subset of the enteric bacteria gene the confrontation of the two genomes emerged that some genes persist as partially indicating that the function was lost during the process and that consequent events of erosion shortened the length as documented in hypothesis is confirmed by the analysis of the pseudogenes of where the number of deletions was more than ten times higher compared to the as with other small genome this mutualistic endosymbiont has experienced a vast reduction of functional activity with a major exception compared to other parasites  still retain the ability of production of amino acid needed by its common effects of the genome shrinking between this endosymbiont and the other parasites are the reduction of the ability to produce repair and recombination and an overall conversion of the composition of the gene to a richer content due to mutation and of the deletion of the function of repair and recombination is the loss of the gene gene involved in the recombinase event happened during the removal of a larger region containing ten genes for a total of almost faith occurred and genes encoding for excision enzymes involved in the repair damaged due to of the most plausible mechanisms for the explanation of the genome shrinking is the chromosomal rearrangement because of larger portion of sequence are more easily to be seen in during homologous recombination compared to the therefore the spread of the transposable elements will positively affect the rate of loss of those genes in the early stages of miniaturization not only this function but must played a role in the evolution of the consequent of the fact that larger event of removal occurred before smaller deletion emerged from the comparison of the genome of and a reconstructed where the gene that have been lost are in fact not randomly dispersed in the ancestor gene but aggregated and the negative relation between number of lost genes and length of the event of small local indels plays a marginal
role on the genome reduction especially in the early stages where a larger number of genes became events instead occurred due to the lack of selection pressure for the retention of genes especially if part of a pathway that lost its function during a previous example for this is the deletion of gene required for the function of and its flanking of the consequences of the elimination of such amount of sequences affected even the regulation of the remaining loss of large section of genomes could in fact lead to a loss in promotor could in fact pushed the selection for the evolution of polycistronic regions with a positive effect for both size reduction and transcription example of the miniaturization of the genome occurred in the an anaerobic intracellular parasite of arthropods evolved from aerobic this process the mitosomes was formed consequent to the reduction of the mitochondria to a relic voided of genomes and metabolic activity except to the production of iron sulfur centers and the capacity to enter into the host for the miniaturized as many other organelles have been almost lost during the process of the formation of the smallest genome found in the their possible a zygomycotine the microsporidia shrunk its genome eliminating almost genes and reduced even the size of protein and extreme process was possible thanks to the advantageous selection for a smaller cell size imposed by the example of miniaturization is represented by the presence of enslaved inside of the cell of two different cryptophytes and are characterized by one of the smallest genomes known and and as noticed for some genomes are noticeable reduced in length compared to other eukaryotes due to a virtual lack of most interesting factor is represented by the coexistence of those small nuclei inside of a cell that contains another nucleus that never experienced such genome even if the host cells have different volumes from species to species and a consequent variability in genome the nucleomorph remain invariant denoting a double effect of selection within the same is a collection of poems by first published in as the third volume in a series of books entitled and is

of they are generally treated they are treated separately here as has three a definite corresponding in many cases to an indefinite corresponding to and a partitive used roughly like in definite article derives from a distal evolved from the article which shared resemblance to modern and acquired the marking of generic practise was common by the although it has been argued that this became

specific item when both the speaker and the audience know what the item is necessary in the following the definite article is also used with mass nouns and plural nouns with generic and with abstract indefinite article is analogous to the indefinite article the indefinite article is used with a noun referring to a or to a specific item when the speaker and audience do not both know what the item «

some or simply have partitive article takes the following except after a negative the partitive article is formed by combining the preposition with the definite note that in the and after a negative the indefinite and partitive articles take the same this makes as there is no clear difference in meaning in these grammarians actually classify as either exclusively indefinite or exclusively and say that the other article has no plural does not affect the interpreted meaning of like other agree in gender and number with the noun they modify in this possessive determiners called analogous to are used to indicate the possessor of the noun they lexically mark the person and number of the and are inflected to agree with their noun in gender and distinguishes between masculine and feminine

a natural phenomenon in which two or more often and that share common have come to mimic each other's honest warning to their mutual works because predators can learn to avoid all of them with fewer experiences with members of any one of the relevant is named after the naturalist who first proposed the concept in supporting his theory with the first mathematical model of one of the first such models anywhere in mimicry was first identified in tropical butterflies that shared colourful wing but it is found in many groups of insects such as and other animals including poison frogs and coral mimicry need not be for many
snakes share auditory warning the defences involved are not limited to anything that tends to deter such as foul sharp or defensive behaviour can make a species unprofitable enough to predators to allow mimicry to a pair of mimics has other mimics may join them by advergent evolution species changing to conform to the appearance of the rather than mutual forming mimicry rings are found for example in velvet the frequency of mimics is positively correlated with rarer mimics are likely to adapt to resemble commoner favouring both advergence and larger mimicry mimics are not strongly protected by venom or other honest mimicry grades into bluffing mimicry was proposed by the zoologist and naturalist always known as early proponent of offered the first explanation for resemblance between certain butterflies that had puzzled the naturalist in like spent a significant part of his life in as described in his book on the conjectured that these abundant and distasteful butterflies might have been caused to resemble each other by their physical had also seen these butterflies first and like had collected and he proposed a variety of other was sexual namely that individuals would choose to mate with partners with such as those resembling other if as is females are the then mimicry would be seen in but in sexually dimorphic females are more often as wrote in that species may evolve a similar appearance so as to share the costs of predator account was one of the earliest uses of a mathematical model in evolutionary and the first exact model of calls mathematical assumption behind the model presumed that the predators had to attack n unprofitable prey in a summer to experience and learn their warning a and a the total numbers of two unprofitable prey if the species are completely unalike they each lose n if they resemble each then species loses and species loses therefore gains and species similarly gains proportional gain compared to the total population of species is and similarly for species giving the per head fitness gain of the mimicry when the predators have been fully the proportion was which equals and the rarer species gains far more than the commoner model is an and assumes the species are equally one is more distasteful than the then the relative gains differ the less distasteful species benefiting more a square of the relative from the protection afforded by can be thought of as parasitic or the mimic benefiting at the expense of the models are more complex and take factors such as rarity into assumption of a fixed number n to be attacked is also effectively assumed a step when a gradual change functional is more have not always viewed the mechanism as both because the term was strongly associated with and because no deceit was involved—unlike the situation in the aposematic signals given by mimics are no longer in for mimicry included and mimicry relies on or warning organisms with these honest signals are avoided by which quickly learn after a bad experience not to pursue the same unprofitable prey is not actually necessary for animals which instinctively avoid certain learning from experience is more underlying concept with predators that learn is that the warning signal makes the harmful organism easier to remember than if it remained as well camouflaged as and camouflage are in this way opposing but this does not mean they are mutually animals remain inconspicuous until then suddenly employ warning such as startling bright colours on their undersides or loud this they enjoy the best of both strategies may also be employed differentially throughout large white butterflies are aposematic as but are mimics once they emerge from development as adult different prey of the same predator could all employ their own warning but this would make no sense for any they could all agree on a common warning the predator would have fewer detrimental and the prey would lose fewer individuals educating such conference needs to take as a prey species that just so happens to look a little like an unprofitable species will be safer than its enabling natural selection to drive the prey species toward a single warning can lead to the evolution of both and depending on whether the mimic is itself unprofitable to its or just a species can join the protective expanding the mimicry thus provided an explanation for the mimicry was in his a case of exploitation by one but rather a mutualistic though his mathematical model indicated a pronounced strategy is usually contrasted with in which one harmless species adopts the appearance of an unprofitable species to gain the advantage of predators' mimicry is thus in a sense parasitic on the model's whereas is to mutual because comimics may have differing degrees of the distinction between and mimicry is not and there can be said to be a spectrum between the two butterflies and monarchs of admiral are both poisonous though they were long thought to be analysis of admiral butterflies shows that the viceroy is the basal lineage of two western sister species in variation in wing patterns appears to have preceded the evolution of while other species remain refuting the hypothesis that the toxicity of these butterflies is a conserved characteristic from a common mimicry need not involve visual it may employ any of the many snakes share the same auditory warning forming an auditory mimicry than one signal may be snakes can make use of both auditory signals and warning is a negative correlation between the frequency of mimics and the of both species implies that it is reproductively beneficial for both species if the models outnumber the this increases the negative interactions between predator and insight into the evolution of mimetic color mimicry in in particular can be seen through the study of the gene is responsible for the butterflies' signature red wing patterns that help it signal to predators that it is sharing this coloration with other poisonous red winged
butterflies the predator may have pursued previously the butterfly increases its chance of survival through mapping the genome of many related species of butterflies that the evolution of a single transcription factor can repeatedly drive the convergent evolution of complex color patterns in distantly related suggests that the evolution of a piece of that regulates the transcription of nearby genes can be the reason behind similar phenotypic coloration between distant making it hard to determine if the trait is homologous or simply the result of convergent proposed mechanism for mimicry is the step states that a large mutational leap initially establishes an approximate resemblance of the mimic to the both species already being a second smaller changes establish a closer is only likely to when a trait is governed by a single and many coloration patterns are certainly controlled by multiple mimic poison frog is with a striped morph that imitates the black and yellow striped morph of a spotted morph that imitates the largely highland spotted morph also of and a banded morph that imitates the red and black banded has thus apparently evolved in separate populations to resemble different it has changed to resemble those target rather than both and the other species mutually converging in the way that supposed for tropical advergence may be mechanism was proposed by the entomologist in and has remained the evolutionary biologist reviewing the situation in suggested that in advergence may be more common than advergent the mimicking species responds to predation by coming to resemble the model more and more initial benefit is thus to the and there is no implied as there would be with original convergence once model and mimic have become closely some degree of mutual protection becomes theory would predict that all mimicking species in an area should converge on a single pattern of does not appear to happen in as butterflies form multiple mimicry rings in a single geographical finding implies that additional evolutionary forces are probably at mimicry often occurs in clusters of multiple species called mimicry is not limited to where rings are mimicry rings occur among such as and other and among vertebrates including fish and coral are all aposematically coloured in often of and and all their females have so they are certainly unprofitable to is

influence is an agent of some stature who uses his or her position to influence public opinion or decision making to produce results beneficial to the country whose intelligence service operates the of influence are often the most difficult agents to as there is seldom material evidence that connects them with a foreign but they can be among the most effective means of influencing foreign opinion and actions as they hold considerable credibility among the target commonly they serve the interests of a foreign power in one of three either as a controlled agent directly recruited and controlled by a foreign as a that consciously collaborates to advance foreign interests but is not directly recruited or controlled by a foreign or as a that is completely unaware of how their actions further the interests of a foreign term of is often used to describe both individuals and organizations engaged in influence engaged in this type of influence operation may serve in the fields of or a number of other professional opinion and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of addition to individual agents of front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this examples of front organizations serving as agents of focusing largely on the were many the the of the of the of the for and the individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign their affiliation becomes and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of primary characteristic that distinguishes agents of influence from spies is the lack of absolute control exercised by the foreign power on an agent of to the work of an agent of influence be far more and dangerous than that of a mere witnessed in the through the best agents of influence were those whose interests paralleled that of the aggressor's and needed little if any foreign power can rarely exercise complete control over an agent of as these agents possess their own preferences and the most proven way to cultivate the desired results is for a foreign power to choose and develop an agent of influence whose interests already align with their an agent of influence's different motivations can have negative as witnessed in when political warfare strategists sent back to in an effort to foster domestic instability and get out of the war in had different motivations and interests than the government at the he acted in a manner not suited to and grew so powerful that his party was instrumental to bringing down efforts to control or exploit agents of influence can also have negative agents are best seen as strategic or tactical and efforts to exercise too much control over them may result in the loss of an influence exploitation of these agents can lead to their exposure by forcing them to take questionably as witnessed in the exposure of these agents exercise their positions and opinions are not wholly but the level to which they coordinate activities with a hostile power is likely to be kept of influence are most effective because they bring with them a sense of credibility among the target and they use this credibility to convey a story or manipulate a situation in favor of the foreign power with which they share common preferences and credibility makes agents of influence so effective according to using these agents is an act of war the same sense that armies crashing across border or airplanes dropping bombs are acts of war because their results can be as
intrusive or conclusive as the results of armies or operating as an agent of influence may serve in the fields of or a number of other professional opinion and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of following are some notable individuals that have been accused of being foreign agents of list is not exhaustive but is meant to show the wide range in which such agents can previously proving someone is an agent of influence is among the most difficult even for the most skilled counterintelligence addition to individual agents of front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign their affiliation becomes and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of is important to that not all front organizations focus exclusively on influence as some have more specific objectives is a recent example of increased use of not only front but of front organizations being used as agents of influence to alter the target nation's belief system and policies on the international use of organizations as agents of influence during

the rule of truth is contingent upon  rule of truth is contingent on we can only know of existence by being able to clearly and distinctly perceive of worry that arises from rejection is the worry of how we can ever come to know of the foundational principles that are needed in order to have can only know something through the foundations of knowledge so a question of interest that arises is how does one know the foundations of knowledge  both at the time that wrote and have
argued that this involves a circular as he relies upon the principle of clarity and distinctness to argue for the existence of and then claims that is the guarantor of his clear and distinct first person to raise this criticism was in the of to the are not yet certain of the existence of and you say that you are not certain of follows from this that you do not yet clearly and distinctly know that you are a thinking on your own that knowledge depends on the clear knowledge of an existing and this you have not proved in the passage where you draw the conclusion that you clearly know what you own response to this in his to the of is first to give what has become known as the he points out that in the fifth he did not say that he needed to guarantee the truth of his clear and distinct only to guarantee his said that we can know nothing for certain until we are aware that expressly declared that was speaking only of knowledge of those conclusions which can be recalled when we are no longer attending to the arguments by means of which we deduced he explicitly denies that the is an someone says am therefore or exist' he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a but recognizes it as something by a simple intuition of the he points out that the certainty of clear and distinct ideas does not depend upon guarantee in particular is immune to the strongest is one of objected to argument regarding what is referred to as accuses of circular says reasons in a circle because according to since we know that exists what we clearly and distinctly perceive is according to we are certain that exists because we can clearly and distinctly perceive states that before we can come to the conclusion of existence we must be sure that whatever we clearly and distinctly perceive is this is stating that existence cannot be used to prove that what one clearly and distinctly perceives is worry that arises from rejection is the worry of how we can ever come to know of the foundational principles that are needed in order to have can only know something through the foundations of knowledge so a question of interest that arises is how does one know the foundations of knowledge presents the memory defense as one is actually intuiting a given no doubt can be any doubt there can be must be entertained when one is not intuiting the goes on to trouble with system is not that it is nor that there is an illegitimate relation between the proofs of and the clear and distinct perceptions trouble is that the proofs of are invalid and do not convince even when they are supposedly being distinction appropriate here is that between and both are true and cannot be but the latter is true and certain the guarantee of while the former is true and that and objectively possible does not need the guarantee of more interesting defense of against the charge of circularity is developed by in his book and the of in reprinted by suggests that arguments for the existence of and for the reliability of are not intended to prove that their conclusions are absolutely but to show that reason can be compelled to accept even in the face of radical skeptical according to the validation of reason is accomplished by the rejection of the main sceptical which is the first real conclusion of the whilst the proposition about existence is a merely preparatory must be conceded that once reached the real conclusion of the the method would forbid the sceptic to reply that perhaps the cartesian proof was suggested to the meditator by the evil genius in the first place accusing of vicious accusation since it requires the evil genius' existence to be still deemed a possibility an idea which after the expanded the meditator has acquired a specific reason to according to the proof presupposes the validity of the principle of since otherwise an argument leading to the conclusion that a benevolent wouldn't force to reject the possible existence of the the proof after beg the question against a kind of skepticism radical enough to put in doubt the rule of according to the meditator feels forced to accept his conclusion merely because of the evidence of the supporting while himself started by explaining that the radical doubt is meant to be a criticism of evidence as a criterion of truth subjective if you pointed it seems hard to deny that the general proposition statements can be false or can be thought without and that seems to have countenanced this kind of when close to the end of the he wrote that sometimes think that others are in error respecting

eating leaves and fruits and occasionally insects and other small readily climbs into scrub and low branches of trees although it is not as versatile as a breeds in shallow the female rearing about four litters of pups during the bank vole is a small rodent resembling a mouse when young but developing a stouter a slightly rounder head with smaller ears and eyes and a hairy dorsal surface is with

the bark of trees including maples and larch up to several metres above the also eats tree seedlings and reduces the natural regeneration of woodland and when present in large is considered a forest its harmfulness is relatively low in a healthy ecosystem because significant damage only occurs when numbers build and because it has a large number of natural enemies its population is normally kept

cerebellar which results in a lack of muscle control and coordination of the upper and lower symptoms are caused by a genetic mutation that results in an expansion of abnormal trinucleotide repeats in the gene that results in an abnormal form of the protein ataxin which causes degeneration of cells in the such as clumsiness and make commonly mistaken for drunkenness or disease is a type of spinocerebellar ataxia and is the most common cause of causes ophthalmoplegia and mixed sensory and cerebellar of are memory difficulty with speech and weakness in arms and frequent urination and involuntary eye can begin in early adolescence and they get worse over leads to intellectual functions usually remain the and are centers of the disease in the disease has multiple origins as comes from haplotype of four different origins and was not from one origin in the and all have been founder effects in areas with ataxia type on the are believed to have come from northeast where and have

diagnosed with living in were also diagnosed with same origin for is found in the and in only have it since and also developed the mutation causing type has been estimated to have occurred to years the oldest causative mutation appears to have occurred about years aboriginal the founder mutation appears to have occurred about years this mutation is shared with other families based in it seems likely that it was imported into affected and had haplotypes in common while also had haplotypes of two different disease is caused by a mutation in the which is located on chromosome exon the gene contains lengthy irregular repetitions of the code producing a mutated protein called the number of copies is between and is an autosomal dominant meaning that if either parent gives the defective gene to a the child will show symptoms of the if one parent suffers from this disease and the other parent does there will be a chance of their child inheriting the pons structure located on the brain is one of the areas affected by striatum brain area connected to balance and is also affected by this which could explain both of the main motor problems cause by the tightening and twisting of the limb and the irregular affected this protein builds up and assembles intranuclear inclusion insoluble aggregates are hypothesized to interfere with the normal activity of the nucleus and induce the cell to degenerate and can be diagnosed by recognizing the symptoms of

creation of the as we know with contributing his code development as the original platform upon which the internet is now wrote and the this makes the distinction between two kinds of software first is the conventional kind of development method according to like the building of a central tight organization and one process from start to second is the progressive which is more like great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of latter analogy points to the discussion involved in an development between the two styles of according to and are in general the handling of bug reports and feature and the constraints under which the programmers are software the programmers are often spending a lot of time dealing with and creating bug as well as handling feature time is spent on creating and prioritizing further development leads to part of the development team spending a lot of time on these and not on the actual in the development teams must often work under constraints as that interfere with technical issues of the software these issues are solved by integrating the users of the software in the development or even letting these users build the system software development can be divided into several phases specified here are derived from et diagram displaying the structure of software development is shown on the this the phases of software development are along with the corresponding data diagram is made using the and modeling are several ways in which work on an project can observed in his essay and the that announcing the intent for a project is usually inferior to releasing a working project to the a common mistake to start a project when contributing to an existing similar project would be more effective start a successful project it is very important to investigate what's already process starts with a choice between the adopting of an existing or the starting of a new a new project is the process goes to the an existing project is the process goes directly to the types of projects there is the garden variety of software programs and which consist of standalone pieces of might even be dependent on other projects serve a specified purpose and fill a definite of this type of project include the the web browser and the office suite of are another type of are collections of software that are published from the same source with a common most prominent example of a is an operating are many distributions as which ship the kernel along with many are other like the programming language for various operating and distributions of programs for like the maintain the source code of an entire operating the kernel and all of its core in one revision control developing the entire system together as a single operating system development projects closely integrate their more so than in the other there is the book or standalone document items usually do not ship as part of an software hosts many such projects that document various aspects of the operating are many other examples of this type of is hard to run an project following a more traditional software development method like the waterfall because in these traditional methods it is not allowed to go back to a previous software requirements are rarely gathered before the start of the instead they are based on early releases of the software as often volunteer staff is attracted to help develop the software product based on the early releases of the networking effect is essential according to et “if the introduced prototype gathers enough it will gradually start to attract more and more et also point out that the community is very much like the business world of “if you find the customers you but without customers you argues that “rapid incremental and evolutionary spiral rapid application extreme programming and the agile software process can be equally applied to proprietary and open source also pinpoints as an extremely useful method for open source software all programming methods are applicable to software because of their iterative and incremental method are equally useful for both open and closed source software for example is suitable for software development because of the distributed development principle it uses geographically distributed teams to ‘work around the mostly adopted by large they're the only ones which afford development centers in different time works equally well in open source projects because a software developed by a large group of volunteers shall naturally tend to have developers spread across all time and users of an project are not all necessarily working on the project

wheelbase suitable for a maximum bodied length of with width the only other differences from it and the was that the frame was made of rather than steel and the rear axle was of a slightly larger only two versions were the had vacuum brakes and the largest customer was who took over as well as one batch of with bodies and a further and from a frustrated the rest of which was shared between and were

oriented ventilation slots for the radiator which gave space for the were to be the only to be built with this new and also the only fitted from new with such a were two facts which accounted for when

coachbuilders not just in were prone to take industrial action with so the closure was to set an example to the rest of and secondly that needed the space to lorry cabs with reason contradicts the but customers felt the lack of the body and outside notably the felt the benefit as their lightweight body was introduced during capturing the mood of the initial range of fitted with the bonnet were as

sources of water and with most other is is characterized by reproductive division of cooperative care of the and overlapping binomial name was assigned by in translates to which probably refers to the gaster sitting directly on top of the petiole in the abdomen of the ant  common names house and come from the odor the ants produce when which is very similar to the pungent odor of a rotting blue or is a small ant that ranges in color from brown to and varies in length from to  inches these ants leave a smell which leads to their nickname gaster portion of the abdomen sits directly on top of the petiole in the abdomen of this which helps distinguish them from other invasive comparison of the side view of the and a diagram of the a typical ant body shows how the gaster sits atop its leads to a very small petiole and to the gaster being pointed anal pore then opens ventrally the instead of antennae have queens lay the eggs which incubate between the larval stage lasts between and the and

usually have multiple odorous house ant is workers have been observed to continue living and working with little some queens with crushed abdomens still lay and there are documented instances of queens surviving without food or water for over two also appear highly tolerant to heat and ants are difficult to remove from a home after their colony has become offered a choice of food the ants preferred sugar and protein over and this preference persisted in all specific sugar sources were studied the ants preferred sucrose over other such as fructose or  collect food that is around the

that food was spread through animal regurgitating food for this trophallactic spread of the workers kept most of the also found that some queens received more food than suggesting a dominance hierarchy even between also found that the nests were located in a system of and that their distribution depended on where food was found and the distance between these patches of was also found that the rate of trophallactic feeding depends on the number of ants per and the quality of food the number of donors is kept but the number of total individuals in more individuals test positive for the food indicates that more individuals are but the amount they eat is the number of donors was and the size of the overall population the number of individuals receiving food more than again indicating that the number of individuals fed but that the per capita amount of food consumed searching for primary orientation is when ants are exploring a new terrain without the guidance of odor orientation is when terrain has been and there are odor trails which ants use to orient
ants are orienting themselves for the first time they often rely on major types of elements they rely on are bilaterally bilaterally unilaterally and unilaterally use these types of surfaces to orient and lay the first odor which can then be followed in the to the food by other was also found that this ant species practices seasonal multiple colony to have access to multiple food colony will overwinter in a single and then during spring and summer when resources are more abundant they will form multiple allows them to better use food that might be spread the winter they will return again to the same nest polydomy is rather and only found in of all polydomous polydomy is not found in many ant but there are many ant including which move within a to better forage sites is activity patterns of the ants were also and corresponding to the seasonal it was observed that the ants displayed the most activity between and and displayed almost no activity from to activity patterns were also foraged during the but in that pattern changed and the ant began to forage during both day and most of the shows low levels of activity throughout the day and between species is often classified as exploitation or involves finding and using limited resources before they can be used by other while interference is the act of preventing others from getting resources by more direct force or it comes to these a species is considered if it initiates an attack and if it avoids other comparison with eight other ant the was more subordinate on the dominant to subordinate ant does not show a large propensity for preferring to use chemical secretions instead of the a subordinate was in the presence of dominant ant species such as and they reduced the amount of time spent was tested with the use of and when the subordinate such as encountered a dominant species they would leave the would then make sense that the subordinate species would forage at a different time than dominant so that they could avoid but there is sizable overlap in foraging period on a daily and seasonal the forages at the same time as dominant but avoids other foraging they must have excellent exploitative abilities to of the invasive species that has had to contend with is the of its interactions with has helped researchers better understand the aggression of ants rarely fight alongside their only were observed to have fought collectively in six of forty often caused to lose altercations with other ant such as the even when more individuals were other ant species like fight the do is however more likely to win in interactions because they have effective chemical species is a scavenger predator ant that will eat most household especially those that contain as well as other they will colonize

not hard to they are vulnerable to most which are especially effective when applied as soon as their presence is dealt with their numbers can be brought under control in just a few the longer a colony is the larger the population becomes and the longer it will take to clear the infestation possibly a few ants most commonly invade buildings in late winter and early spring after at which times one should be on the lookout for ants foraging discourage standing water should be eliminated in the as are attracted to should be trimmed away from so they do not make convenient routes for holes and

has three an alveolar recess pointed bounded by the alveolar process of the a zygomatic recess pointed bounded by the zygomatic and an infraorbital recess pointed bounded by the inferior orbital surface of the medial wall is composed primarily of ostia for drainage are located high on the medial wall and open into the semilunar hiatus of the lateral nasal because of the position of the gravity cannot drain the maxillary sinus contents when the head is erect ostium of the maxillary sinus is high up on the medial wall and on average is in with a mean volume of about sinus is lined

and periosteum on the osseous size of the sinuses varies in different and even on the two sides of the same infraorbital canal usually projects into the cavity as a ridge extending from the roof to the anterior additional ridges are sometimes seen in the posterior wall of the cavity and are caused by the alveolar mucous membranes receive their postganglionic parasympathetic nerve innervation for mucous secretion originating from the greater petrosal nerve branch of the facial superior alveolar and branches of the maxillary nerve provide sensory nasal wall of the maxillary or in the

sinusitis are usually near the involved and nasal or pharyngeal possibly with some systemic signs of infection such as fever and skin over the involved sinus can be and even reddened due to the inflammatory process in the there is opacification of the usually translucent sinus due to retained sinusitis is common due to the close anatomic relation of the frontal anterior ethmoidal sinus and the maxillary allowing for easy spread of diagnosis of dental problems needs to be done due to the close proximity to the teeth since the pain from sinusitis can seem to be dentally the drainage

for nearly half of the incidence of maxillary is always a thin layer of mucous membrane and usually bone between the roots of the upper back teeth and the floor of the maxillary the bone can vary in

and are important cleaner fish in the reefs they is found in coral reefs of the main range includes the and the southeast area of the of females and males have yellow upper bodies and white lower often with green or black lateral stripes and occasionally dark vertical coloration is known as the initial can rapidly alter the presence or intensity of their yellow and and these color changes appear to correspond to behavioral females and some males can permanently change coloration sex and enter the terminal phase which has a blue black and white bars behind the and a green color phase gives the species its phase males are larger to than the initial phase males forages for and other small as well as parasites on other phase males eat primarily zooplankton from and females and initial phase males have certain hunting times during the is a common cleaner

roughtail and the significant parasite of is the intracellular myxozoan which can be found in the ovaries of eggs are sterile and are also larger than uninfected and contain more organic and inorganic implies the parasite causes a shift in resources from the mother to the eggs and decreases the fitness of the bluehead wrasses have been found to change sex earlier than uninfected possibly in response to the is widespread in the northwestern region and is one of the most abundant species in coral reefs near the and the is listed under this species shows high site so coral reef destruction could cause local to its bright it is sometimes collected for the aquarium but this is not a threat to the many other wrasse is a protogynous sequential individuals may begin life either as males or

mate when they can get a chance in a larger change of the indicates their motive or terminal phase males chase initial phase their color changes to a metallic whereas when they are courting a they become and form black circles on their phase females and initial phase males both can change into terminal phase change can be relative taking around this change in sex is once an initial phase female or male changes into a terminal phase it cannot change experiment removing terminal phase males from a population showed that more females changed into terminal phase and even aggression levels increased and coloration changes occurred to signify the female's change to terminal phase initial phase males have comparatively larger testes than the terminal phase enables the initial phase males to produce more sperm for the snatched opportunities they must take when trying to fertilize the eggs of the females in the guarded phase males also achieve fertilizations through participating in group groups consist of or more males that congregate at specific sites during the daily spawning period on medium and larger sized visit these groups to spawn and release eggs in a 'spawning males attempt to position themselves next to a female when she releases her as this maximizes their probability of fertilizing these large numbers of sperm also increases this probability and this is thought to also help explain the large testis size observed in type of mating competition is referred to as 'sperm competition' and is seen in many and its the saddle wrasse have become important models for understanding the physiological and neurobiological bases of sex change can be induced socially in both species by making large females the largest members of social change in experimental pens by saddle wrasses involves complete gonadal transformation with associated decreases in a key steroid hormones and and steroid hormone synthesizing enzymes in the changing saddle wrasses also show substantial changes in brain levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters and phase terminal phase and females have the capability of is due to the or the female's ability to become a density of the type of male depends on the size of the are more terminal phase males than initial phase males on smaller on which they guard a small number of on larger there are equal proportions of initial phase and terminal phase increases the chances of initial phase males to mate because they are less aggressive compared to terminal phase change has been studied in bluehead wrasses primarily using field where it can be induced in large females by removing dominant terminal phase males from small hormone neurons differ across sexual phenotypes in the hypothalamus of bluehead wrasses and also with androgen implants that induce sex sex change is very rapid in under field with behaviors being observed within minutes to hours after dominant terminal phase males are sex change occurs even in females whose gonads have been surgically removed prior to becoming socially sex change is associated with increases in expression of a neuropeptide hormone termed arginine vasotocin or and these increases occur regardless of whether sex changing females have gonads or of can induce sexual and aggressive behaviors in terminal phase male bluehead wrasses while injections of fluoxetine can reduce aggressive behaviors by terminal phase terminal phase males will defend breeding sites to which females migrate on a daily study was done to estimate the relative roles of each sex in choosing the location of such terminal phase males or all females were replaced in local isolated and the resulting site use was males were the mating system was not the other after the females were half of the old sites were lost and the same number of new sites came into and continued to be occupied for over a year after these occurred although large males originally continued to defend and display at the original this shows the importance of female choice in the feeding system of the and that males will respond to the females’ site do not have distinct territories and their populations roam the females usually do not leave their original spawning males are known be taken away or plausible reason for why the females stay could be that they are most accustomed to those and also because the predator threat is of the literature on mating systems of the wrasse was described in small patches of concentrated reef a linear barrier reef in very large aggregations of form daily in a single area near the foreside of the studies have shown that fish are generally faithful to particular feeding schools that are assorted throughout the and that they tend to migrate to spawning grounds over kilometers is no mating that appears to happen in other
upcurrent areas of the large differences in the times that are spent on the there are no significant differences in the fecundity or frequency of spawning among females that live at different distances from the mating higher growth rate corresponded to a higher general feeding rate in the suggesting that food intake may outweigh the costs of the long summation summation is a summation method for divergent introduced by is particularly useful for summing divergent asymptotic and in some sense gives the best possible sum for such are several variations of this method that are also called and a generalization of it called are three slightly different methods called differ in which series they can but are meaning that if two of the methods sum the same series they give the same let denote a formal power series and define the transform of to be its equivalent exponential series denote the partial sum weak form of summation method defines the sum of to be this converges at to some we say that the weak sum of converges at and write that the transform converges for all positive real numbers to a function growing sufficiently slowly that the following integral is well defined an improper the sum of is given by the integral converges at to some we say that the sum of converges at and write is similar to integral summation except that the transform need not converge for all but converges to an analytic function of near that can be analytically continued along the positive real methods and are both regular summation meaning that whenever converges the standard then the sum and weak sum also and do so to the same of is easily seen by a change in order of which is valid due to absolute if is convergent at then where the rightmost expression is exactly the sum at of and imply that these methods provide analytic extensions to series that is weak summable at is also summable at one can construct examples of series which are divergent under weak but which are following theorem characterises the equivalence of the two are always many different functions with any given asymptotic there is sometimes a best possible in the sense that the errors in the approximations are as small as possible in some theorem and theorem show that summation produces such a best possible sum of the theorem gives conditions for a function to be the sum of its asymptotic that is a function satisfying the following is bounded by for all in the region some positive constant theorem says that in this region is given by the sum of its asymptotic the series for the transform converges in a neighborhood of the and can be analytically continued to the positive real and the integral defining the sum converges to for in the region more is still determined by its asymptotic series if the in the error estimate above is replaced by provided the condition is replaced by is in some sense best as there are counterexamples if the number is replaced by any smaller theorem shows that a function is uniquely determined by an asymptotic series in a sector provided the errors in the finite order approximations do not grow too precisely it states that if is analytic in the interior of the sector and in this region for all then is zero provided that the series theorem gives a summation method for any asymptotic series whose terms do not grow too as the sum can be defined to be the unique function with this asymptotic series in a suitable sector if it summation is slightly weaker than special case of this when for some constant generally one can define summation methods slightly stronger than by taking the numbers to be slightly for example or practice this generalization is of little as there are almost no natural examples of series summable by this method that cannot also be summed by function has the asymptotic series with an error bound of the form above in the region for any but is not given by the sum of its asymptotic shows that the number in theorem cannot be replaced by any smaller number the bound on the error is made the geometric series which converges the standard to for transform is from which we obtain the sum which converges in the larger region giving an analytic continuation of the original instead the weak the partial sums are given by and so the weak sum is convergence is on this can be seen by appealing to part of the equivalence since for the series then does not converge for any nonzero transform is for which can be analytically continued to the sum is is the incomplete gamma integral converges for all so the original divergent series is summable for all function has an asymptotic expansion as tends to that is given by the original divergent is a typical example of the fact that summation will sometimes sum divergent asymptotic since  for all the equivalence theorem ensures that weak summation has the same domain of following example extends on that given in changing the order of the transform is given by the sum is given by where is the the convergence theorem along the integral converges for all the integral diverges for the weak sum we note that holds only for and so the weak sum converges on this smaller a formal series is summable at then it is also summable at all points on the chord connecting to the there exists a function analytic throughout the disk with radius such that for all immediate consequence is that the domain of convergence of the sum is a star domain in can be said about the domain of convergence of the than that it is a star which is referred to as the and is determined by the singularities of the series that has strictly positive radius of so that it
is analytic in a region containing the and let denote the set of singularities of means that if and only if can be continued analytically along the open chord from to but not to let denote the line passing through which is perpendicular to the chord the sets the set of points which lie on the same side of as the polygon of is the set alternative definition was used by and denote the largest star domain on which there is an analytic extension of then is the largest subset of such that for all the interior of the circle with diameter is contained in to the set as a polygon is somewhat of a since the set need not be polygonal at has only finitely many singularities then will in fact be a following due to and provides convergence criteria for that summability for depends on the nature of the denote the roots of and consider which converges on as a function on has singularities at and consequently the polygon is given by the regular centred at the and such that is a midpoint of an formal series converges for all by the comparison test with the geometric can however be shown that does not converge for any point such that for some the set of such is dense in the unit there can be no analytic extension of outside of the largest star domain to which can be analytically extended is from which the second one obtains particular one sees that the polygon is not theorem provides conditions under which convergence of one summation method implies convergence under another principal theorem for summation provides conditions under which the weak method implies convergence of the summation finds application in perturbation expansions in quantum field particular in field theory the functions can often be recovered from their perturbation series using summation of the singularities of the transform are related to instantons and renormalons in quantum field theory summation requires that the coefficients do not grow too more has to be bounded by for some is a variation of summation that replaces factorials with for some positive integer which allows the summation of some series with bounded by for some generalization is given by the most general summation is generalized by which can be used when the bounding function is of some general type instead of being exponential was an police captain and the of who was assassinated on the evening of on the

red fog which serve as rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the allowable range of intensity for a rear fog lamp is to which is within the range of a stop lamp fog lamps are not required equipment in the but they are and are found almost exclusively on vehicles in and provide functional rear fog lights on their vehicles from brands which are adaptions of such as the first generation come standard with rear fog or vehicles with market such as the second generation have an option for final generation also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard jurisdictions permit rear fog lamps to be installed either singly or in a single rear fog is most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side in the country in which the vehicle is is to maximise the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog many a single reversing lamp is mounted on the passenger side of the positionally symmetrical with the rear two rear fog lamps are they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's of twin rear fog lamps say two lamps provide vehicle distance information not available from a single of the single rear fog lamp say dual rear fog lamps closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps are mandatorily installed in reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop requires a separation of at least between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog warn adjacent vehicle operators and pedestrians of a vehicle's rearward and to provide illumination to the rear when backing each vehicle must be equipped with one or two reversing are required to produce white light by and international some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing and for vehicle manufacturers were faced with the task of localising cars originally equipped with combination red signal lamps and white reversing countries' regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to burn steadily as reversing so automakers and importers were able to combine the rear turn signal and reversing light and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting countries now require white reversing and the combination amber light is no longer permitted on new state of currently permits reversing lamps to emit white or amber rear registration plate is illuminated by a white lamp designed to light the surface of the plate without creating white light directly visible to the rear of the it must be illuminated whenever the position lamps are vehicles such as trucks and buses are in many cases required to carry additional lighting devices beyond those required on passenger specific requirements vary according to the regulations in force where the vehicle is the and vehicles over wide must be equipped with three amber front and three red rear identification lamps spaced apart at the centre of the front and rear of the as high as front identification lamps are typically mounted atop the cab of purpose of these lamps is to alert other drivers to the presence of a wide type of identification lamp is optional in and is usually made up of three lamps giving such equipped trailers a brake requires vehicles exceeding meters in width to be equipped with left and right white front and red rear marker which serve a purpose comparable to that of the clearance to indicate clearly the vehicle's overall width and front clearance lamp may be amber in and and regulations require large vehicles to be equipped with amber side marker lights and reflectors mounted midway between the front and rear side provides for side marker lights on trucks and other large vehicles producing amber light to the front and red to the rear with no requirement to emit light to the about the in and possibly other many commercial vehicles and some road trains from had a green light mounted on the rear could be operated by the driver to indicate that it was safe for the following vehicle to hazard warning signal called the warning warning or is provided by flashing all of a vehicle's left and right turn signals simultaneously and in warning signals first appeared as aftermarket accessories in the early by the late regulations around the world came to require all new vehicles to be so of the hazard flashers must be from a control independent of the turn signal and an audiovisual must be provided to the function is meant to indicate a hazard such as a vehicle stopped in or near moving a disabled a vehicle moving substantially slower than the flow of traffic such as a truck climbing a steep or the presence of stopped or slow traffic ahead on a high speed vehicles with a separate left and right green turn signal on the both left and right indicators may flash to provide visual indication of the hazard flashers' vehicles with a single green turn signal on the a separate red must be provided for hazard flasher the hazard

with red in countries where № is these must be triangular on trailers and on vehicles other than regulations also require amber in front and red in the and other countries have at various times required white explicitly permit vehicle signal lamps with intensity automatically increased during bright daylight hours when sunlight reduces the effectiveness of the stop and automatically decreased during hours of darkness when glare could be a and regulations contain provisions for determining the minimum and maximum acceptable intensity for lamps that contain more than a single light such as the states of and permit vehicles to be equipped with auxiliary rear signal systems displaying green light when the accelerator is yellow light when the vehicle is and red light when the brake

which is emplaced under each gluteus maximus the insertion of the buttock prosthesis is through a midline incision over the tailbone with a gluteal implant is the method most effective for enlarging the buttocks of the man or of the woman whose body possesses few stores of excess adipose fat in the lower portion of the the buttocks and the anatomic regions where the human body usually stores excess body because of the cutting into the flesh of the tailbone the full healing of the augmented tissues can be approximately in the course of which the tissues and the settled buttocks prostheses are integrated to the gluteal implantation procedure can be performed upon a patient who is either sedated or either under general anaesthesia or under local usual time for a buttocks augmentation

convalescence period allows him or her to resume activities at and the full spectrum of physical activity at the liposuction harvesting of the patient's excess body fat improves the aesthetic appearance of the body fat the human body's chemistry does resorb down and some of the injected and so might diminish the to the degree of diminishment of the volume and contour caused by the the patient might require additional sessions of therapy to achieve the desired and contour of the augmentation of the by rearranging and enhancing the pertinent muscle and fat tissues of the gluteal is realized with a combined gluteoplasty procedure of surgery and liposculpture such a combined procedure is a realistic and feasible treatment for the man and for the woman patient who has undergone massive weight loss in the course of resolving obesity with bariatric the case of the man or woman who presents flat buttocks and a degree of ptosis falling wherein neither surgery nor lipoinjection would be adequate to restoring the natural anatomic contour of the gluteal the application of a combined treatment of autologous flap surgery and lipoinjection can achieve the required functional correction and aesthetic methods for reducing the size of the buttocks include the varieties of such as lipectomy and without ultrasonic to reduce excess body and superficial to and the natural contour of the usual treatment is lipectomy with applied tumescence and wherein the body fat is harvested by aspiration through a cannula that is inserted through a small either to the intergluteal sulcus or to the upper area of the gluteus maximus muscle liposuction can quickly remove a large volume of body fat for the correction of a notable occurrence of a deposit of adipose fat to the buttocks and related anatomic ultrasonic liposuction machine liquefies the excess fat and so more readily facilitates its removal with conventional quick allowed by the ultrasonic lipectomy technique has eliminated the larger and surgical incisions that once were required for removing a large volume of adipose because of the sensitivity of the the skin of the pertinent is cooled in order to prevent ultrasonic heat damage caused by the liquefying and removal of the excess adipose the buttocks with liposculpture is performed with a small cannula specifically for contouring superficial body the configuration of which of open is determined by the type and the degree of gluteal correction to be sculpt rounded contours to buttocks superficial liposculpture allows the plastic surgeon to control the of the superficial liposuction can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required anatomic and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the such as reshaping the lateral area of the buttocks into an athletic study the with indicated that contouring is best achieved by tailoring the and the techniques to the anatomic topography of the body
